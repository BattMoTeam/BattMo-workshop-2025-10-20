Welcome to this hands-on workshop where weâ€™ll explore battery cell simulations through the eyes of BattMo.jl! BattMo.jl is a powerful Julia package for simulating battery cells using physics-based models like the Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model. 

# Setting things up
Lets first ensure we have the software that we need installed and properly configured to start running battery simulations. Go to [Setting things up](Setting_things_up.md) and follow the instructions.
